# Roadmap

We have moved our roadmap to trello to communicate our plans in a single place: 

{% embed url="https://trello.com/b/KakM4F3S/squidex-roadmap" caption="Squidex roadmap" %}

The roadmap is driven by the following sources with the following priorities.

1. Requirements from our collaborations with Enterprises
2. Community feedback and requests
3. Strategic features decide by us.

In general we try to implement smaller features as fast as often, sometimes even on the same day. If possible we try to build features incrementally.

Please post custom feature requests in our support forum: [https://support.squidex.io/](https://support.squidex.io/)
