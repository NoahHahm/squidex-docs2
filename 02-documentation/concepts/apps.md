# Apps

## What is an App?

An app is the highest level or organization in the Squidex hierarchy. Your content lives within a project. Furthermore a project has:

* An optional display name, description and logo to make your app discoverable in the overview.
* Schemas to define the structure of your content.
* Content itself.
* Assets that belong to your app and are linked to your content.
* Rules to model business rules.
* Custom workflow definitions.
* Collaborators who can work on your content with roles and permissions.
* A subscription and an associated plan in the Squidex Cloud.
