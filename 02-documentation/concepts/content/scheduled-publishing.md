# Scheduled Publishing

When you are adding content through the Squidex portal, you can either _Save_ or _Save and Publish_.

_Save and Publish_ publishes the content immediately, however there could be requirements where you would like to publishing the content at a later date. This can be achieved by scheduling contents.

To do this first, you must _Save_ the content only. Once the content is saved navigate back to the list of contents. Select the content(s) that you would like to publish at a later date by using the **checkbox** (1), then click **Published** (2).

On the popup prompt select **Set to Published at a later point date and time** (3) and click **Confirm** (4). Click on the timezone to change between _Local_ & _UTC_ if required.
