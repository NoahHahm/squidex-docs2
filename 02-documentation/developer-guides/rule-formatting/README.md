# Rule Formatting

This page explains the rule formatting system in detail.\
To get an understanding of the rule system read the following page:

{% content-ref url="../../concepts/rules.md" %}
[rules.md](../../concepts/rules.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Introduction

The rule formatting is used to format your custom payloads in rule actions, for example when you use email actions and you want to use certain values from the event inside the email subject or body.

To get an understanding what we can do with the rule system we need to have a look to an event.

This example is a full content event that has been triggered when a new content item has been created.

```javascript
{
    "id": "123...", // Id of the content.
    "actor": { "type": "subject", "id": "123..." }, // Id of the user
    "appId": { "name": "my-app", "id": "123..." }, // App name and id
    "created": "2018-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "createdBy":  { "type": "subject", "id": "123..." },
    "data": { // Content data
        "city": {
            "en": "Munich",
            "de": "MÃ¼nchen"
        },
        "population": {
            "iv": 123000
        }
    },
    "lastModified": "2018-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "lastModifiedBy": { "type": "subject", "id": "123..." },
    "schemaId": { "name": "my-schema", "id": "123..." }, // Schema id
    "status": "Draft", // Status of the content: Draft, Archived, Published
    "timestamp": "2018-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "type": "Created", // The type of the event.
    "user": { // The user information.
        "id": "123...",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@email.com"
    },
    "version": 1 // Version of the content, increased with any operation
}
```

## Formatting Options

The rule formatter gives us access to all properties of this events.

At the moment there are 3 options for formatting:

{% content-ref url="simple.md" %}
[simple.md](simple.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="script.md" %}
[script.md](script.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="liquid.md" %}
[liquid.md](liquid.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The syntax is selected based on the value of the rule property.

* If a value follows the format `Liquid(<Template>)`, then `Template` is interpreted as liquid syntax and interpreted using a template engine.
* If a value follows the format `Script(<Script>)`, then `Script`is interpreted as Javascript expression and interpreted using a scripting engine.
* If none of the syntaxes above is detected, the value is interpreted as simple formatting and interpreted using a built-in solution.

In newer versions of Squidex the user interface has been improved and custom input fields have been introduced which let you select the syntax and add the necessary prefix automatically.

{% hint style="info" %}
The liquid syntax is the most powerful but still easy option and therefore recommended for most use cases.
{% endhint %}
