# Welcome to Squidex

## What is Squidex?

Squidex is a content management hub. A central place to manage all your content.

For example:

* Dynamic elements for your mobile apps.
* Blog posts and articles for your website.
* Configuration data for your backend.
* Rich and structured data for your application.

In contrast to a traditional CMS, Squidex is headless and does not provide the frontend. This makes you free to choose a technology of your choice to create an awesome User Experience.
